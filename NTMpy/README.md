# Two/ Three Temperature model solver 

#### To download                    `pip install NTMpy`

#### To call routines in a script:   `from NTMpy import NTMpy as ntm`
--------------------------------------

This section contains our solver for the two/ three temperature model. 

Initially a phenomenological model proposed by Anisimov _et al._ and then extended to a 3 temperature model by Beaurepaire _et al_. this model is used to describe the dynamics of a material subject to laser induced heating on the surface. 

Note, that this model can also be used to investigate more recent ideas, like the M3TM (Microscopic three Temperature Model), suggested by Koopmans _et al._. 

## Thermophysical parameters (please contribute)

It is current subject to research to evaluate the thermophysical parameters, i.e. heat capacity, heat conductivity and coupling between the systems, needed to run the simulation. In order to build up a working and easy to use software package we are collecting data about those parameters. This data is then stored in a file and will become open access. However, it is not easy to find those parameters. Therefore, we want to encourage every user to **contribute with their knowledge about the parameters in use**. 
That is to either contribute a table with all the parameters and the sources directly to this project or to write a mail to [Lukas Alber](mailto:lukas.alber@fysik.su.se) (project management). 
The format and way of contribution does not matter for now, as we are currently in the process of finding the ideal way to implement the data to the main software.
